**PyLadiesCon - CfP Workshop**

Have you heard of the [PyLadiesCon](https://pyladies.com/blog/Announcement-PyLadies-Conference/global-conference-announcement/)? Do you want to speak there but don't know how to do it? What is a [call for proposal](https://pyladies.com/blog/Announcement-CFP-Launch/cfp-launch-announcement/) and what do you need to submit? Worry not, we will have a CfP (Call for Proposal) workshop for new speakers who have not done it before.

In the workshop, via some exercises, we will help you to find something you want to talk about and start drafting a very rough proposal as a start.
