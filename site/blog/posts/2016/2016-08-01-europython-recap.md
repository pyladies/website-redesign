EuroPython wrapped up July 24th in Bilbao, Spain. As a first time [participant](https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/755056966360326144) I was thrilled to attend, speak, and represent the PSF as a member of the Board of Directors!

First of all, the entire ambience of EuroPython was [*cool*](https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/755104074610122752). The  Gaud&#236;-esque styled venue, the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, is in the heart of new Bilbao only a few minutes walk from the internationally acclaimed [Guggenheim](https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.es/en/). I really enjoyed the EuroPython attendee gift, a beach towel! It came in great use when I visited the beach; Bilbao is only 30 minutes from the Bay of Biscay.

Something else I noticed at EuroPython was the range of languages spoken in the halls. From Spanish (or Castellano to those that speak Euskara, the Basque language) to Dutch to Norwegian I met Pythonistas from all across Europe (and a few from North and South America as well). I had arrived early to EuroPython to participate as a DjangoGirls coach where I tutored in Spanish, a brand new experience for me! If I had to sum up EuroPython in one word it'd be cosmopolitan. 

**Some of my favorite talks**

* Rachel Willmer's keynote [20 Years without a 'Proper' Job](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/keynote-20-years-without-a-proper-job) - generally a discussion on why following your own path is the best path and how Willmer has been doing it and loving it!
* Cameron Macleod's [Implementing a Sound Identifier in Python](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/keynote-20-years-without-a-proper-job) ** also presented in Spanish! - a review on Macleod's implementation using the 'magical' technology behind Shazaam's old sound identification platform, aptly named [abracadabra](https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra) on GitHub. While Macleod didn't have a fully functional prototype he did [challenge us](https://twitter.com/notexactlyawe/status/755073727889543168) to try it ourselves!
* Larry Hastings' Day 1 Lightning Talk [Life as a Meme](https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/755060301838553088) - basically how Larry Hastings became an internet meme affectionately known as [#dsdad](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dsdad&src=typd) <3. 
* Daniele Procida's [Mind, Machines and Python](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/minds-machines-and-python) - an interesting chat about what it could mean to consider intelligence programmatically if we try to understand the structure of intelligence itself. Procida explores the idea of consciousness then as a 'tangled hierarchy' that consists of self-referencing loops, aka things that we use daily in Python programming.
* Radomir Dopieralski's [Making robots walk with Python](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/making-robots-walk-with-python) - exactly as it sounds, a chat about how Dopieralski used Python to make robots walk. The talk is more on the mechanics of what it means to engineer a robot vs. the Python behind the robots. Oh and it has lots of [cute robots](https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/755378634043654144)!
* St&#233;phane Wirtel's [Exploring our Python Interpreter with CPython 3.6.0a+](https://ep2016.europython.eu/conference/talks/exploring-our-python-interpreter) - an excellent introduction to CPython interpreter and how to contribute to CPython. Also, a great proposal for a CPython [patch](http://bugs.python.org/issue25571) so we can more easily [see the Python bytecode](https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/755406890272714752) generated when we do a thing!

All of the talks are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PythonItalia/videos).

If you haven't been to EuroPython before, I strongly encourage you to go! A beautiful setting with great tourist perks, Pythonistas from all over Europe, and great talks? Well, I think you've got nothing to lose.
