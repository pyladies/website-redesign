2020 was quite a complicated year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity has faced multiple unforeseen challenges, to tell the truth, in this modern era no one imagined having to experience something like what is happening. But we would also like to highlight that 2020 has given us a new perspective on how we see things, on everything we take for granted. This was the year we rediscovered the spirit of solidarity and community.


Today, as we see vaccines being rolled out all around the world, we can begin the summer with so much hope and gratitude.


The PyLadies Global Council wants to give a special thanks to all the organizers of the different PyLadies chapters in the world, because despite the difficulties and challenges they have continued to give their time and effort to the community, finding new ways of communicating and staying together.


We are working hard to establish our new goals as a council so that we can move forward together to build our community therefore, we will send out regular updates - so please stay tuned !

If you would like to get in touch or have any questions:

Thanks again to the entire community for your commitment and willingness to continue contributing to share knowledge in this community.
