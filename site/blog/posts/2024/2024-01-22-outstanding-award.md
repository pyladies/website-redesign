Introducing: the Outstanding PyLady Award!

**TL;DR:** Know of a PyLady that should be recognized for all their work for Python and the community?
[Nominate them (or yourself)][nomination form]!

The PyLadies community is made up of many remarkable members and volunteers that make significant 
contributions to bettering the Python community. The Global Council's [Outstanding PyLady award][award docs] is 
meant to elevate diverse Pythonistas doing amazing things, to highlight their achievements, and 
to thank them for all the work they've contributed.

The award is open to women and non-binary PyLadies. Any Python community member may nominate a 
PyLady at any time (including self-nominations! go on â€“ brag about yourself!). 
**Nominations are accepted via [this Google form][nomination form].**

Nominations are accepted year-round, and award winners will be recognized at the nearest upcoming PyCon US.
**For recognition at PyCon US 2024, nominations must be in by February 4th 2024 [AOE].**

For more information about the process, please have a look at our [documentation][award docs].

_The Global Council wants to give a huge thank you to [Cheuk Ting Ho] for proposing the idea of 
recognizing & rewarding individual PyLadies who give a lot of time and effort to make Python and 
its community better!_
