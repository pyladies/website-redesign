# PyLadies Website Redesign

Welcome! 

## Context

[pyladies.com] was designed 12 years ago, and reflects what we wanted 12 years ago.
Our needs have changed, so let's figure out what we want & need!
To best serve our membership, everyone's input is valuable, and we encourage you to share ideas.

## Work-in-Progress Specification

The specification for the website redesign is contained in this [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJcKdVI8WzySoidcRgjzqpCeFHSX4KaMnQHa1ER9mz0/edit?usp=sharing)

## How to use this repo

This repo was created during PyCon 2024 sprints to collect ideas from a group of PyLadies interested in giving their input.
We're collecting issues and tasks related to the redesign (which may be incorporated into the specification).

Please have a look at the current [pyladies.com] and think of ideas of what you'd like to keep, what you'd like to change, what you'd like to add or remove, and any ideas in between.

Let's also consider [kit.pyladies.com] as well!

More structure and details will come in the future. For now, this repo is a catch-all to collect ideas.

## Proof of concept prototypes

While we're still gathering specification requirements, we're not trying to build a production site in this repo (not yet, at least).
We have migrated markdown content and static images (as of May 2024) from the existing [kit.pyladies.com] and [pyladies.com] website into this repo's main branch.
We do welcome proof of concept prototypes as PRs to an individual branch.

For an example of a prototype, you can check this [PR by @willingc](https://github.com/pyladies/website-redesign/pull/2)
