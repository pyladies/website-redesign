# Printing a PyLadies Banner

A banner is useful for conferences and workshops. They can run as little as $20 or as much as $195 for a durable one.

1. Find a local reputable print shop (or an online one) and get an estimate for the size/colors.
2. Use one of the image files in [this folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xtmhqc8oexxkrvc/AAA4Q8pupFFA7N5lS61Q18GBa?dl=0), which are optimized for a 10ftx3ft banner. The svg vector file is recommended, if the printer knows how to handle it, but you will have to provide them with instructions on positioning (centered).
3. Dimensions: 10ft wide by 3ft high works well for standard conference booths, or for draping across a booth table.
4. Colors: The image files contain 2 colors: pink and black. The background is white/transparent.
5. Attachments: you will want grommet holes in all four corners at the very least; more if possible.  Make sure you have extra string or hooks so it looks good hanging, or draped across a table.
